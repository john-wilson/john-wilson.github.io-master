//The main purpose of creating this is to have a simple todo list on what needs to be done.

1) Create a completely new design using CSS and HTML using Table's to reach the design that was 
given. 

Will not create a table based design that's simply this isn't a HTML email I'm creating lol. 

Will be using the div tag to reach this simple design.


2) Splice all the components and layers of each element in the .ai files that were given. 
	Note: John you have to do this in illustrator for me since I'm using Linux. 
	I'll be going into more detail about which layers need to be created for the final design. 
	
	Save each splice into png or jpeg or jpg if you would
3) Finish the source code and finish what needs to be touched up upon. 
	
4) Things to be implemented

Done	 - Background image
	 - Menu
	 - Google fonts (Need to be given to me by John)
	 - Contact form create using Typeform (LOL this is why Javascript was created)
		Note: John Wilson you have to create a less 
		      ugly typeform using typeform.com since 
		      that's what monikoth what's you to do
		Note: Plus I don't have your username and
		      password for typeform. I don't touch
		      garbage unless I have to so I'd rather
		      not use typeform but if I have too
		      respond in a commit. LOL typeform xD
